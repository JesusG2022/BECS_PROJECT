# BECS_PROJECT

Hi everyone, My name is Jesus Garcia Loyola. I am a CS++ cohort 9 progarm. 

# Background
During my Second semester, we have to research a personal project and I choose a Raspberry Pi as my topic. I enjoyed the topic and tried to build but I failed. So I tried a different tutorial and it did work.

Then I was hired as an SA for one of the BECS summers and I wanted to show the other students what they could make if they got excited they should pursue it. and I noticed the projects were the same so I asked if I could build and make tutorials they said yes. So I made 4 more Raspberry Pi project
