# BECS_PROJECT

Hi everyone, My name is Jesus Garcia Loyola. I am a CS++ cohort 9 progarm. 

# Background
During my Second semester, we have to research a personal project and I choose a Raspberry Pi as my topic. I enjoyed the topic and tried to build but I failed. So I tried a different tutorial and it did work.

Then I was hired as an SA for one of the BECS summers and I wanted to show the other students what they could make if they got excited they should pursue it. and I noticed the projects were the same so I asked if I could build and make tutorials they said yes. So I made 4 more Raspberry Pi project

Suppose you wish to add a project or idea. Feel free to do so. 
 
If you add a project please write it down in [**"_PART.md_"**](https://github.com/JesusG2022/BECS_PROJECT/blob/main/Part.md#all-the-parts) by adding "## (new project name)" and then part adds the under it. 

Also please if you can, make a slideshow so people can follow along in the [**slide**](https://github.com/JesusG2022/BECS_PROJECT/tree/main/slides) folder. Just add a new file and share the link so that everyone can view it. 

If you can record yourself to help people out. It can be you test it or show how to build it. If you do put it in the [**Videos**](https://github.com/JesusG2022/BECS_PROJECT/tree/main/Video)  folder :)
